There may have been changes to the config files that you need to work in. It's also a good idea to open the config from the newly downloaded zip file and your config side by side and compare them to changes.</li><li>You are done. Start your Feeder again and wait for it to generate your PT config files. Have a look at those config files and see if they contain what you want them to before starting the Bot again.</li></ol><p>Please follow this process thoroughly.</p><h3 id="additional-note"><a href="#additional-note" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Additional Note</h3><p>On rare occasions, it might be good to delete the database file/folder when upgrading.
